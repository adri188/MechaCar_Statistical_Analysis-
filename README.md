## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![Linear Model](lm.png)

According to our results, vehicle length, ground clearance and the intercept are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. Length and ground clearance have a significant impact on mpg. 

Since the intercept is also significant we could look into additional variables that need to be included to avoid predicting on an  overfitted model 

r Squared value is at 0.72 and  P-value is significant
